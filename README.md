# Background
I have one Digital Ocean droplet with an IP address of 123.23.123.45. I want it to serve multiple websites/apps.

# Goals
- Show my portfolio at kevinmanase.com
- Run my blog at blog.foussa.io
- Have a front for foussa.io
- All of those accessible from both wwww.domain.com & domain.com and `http` & `https`
- Do all of that with Traefik
